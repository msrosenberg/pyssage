This file contains raw latex representations of formulas that might appear in the manual. They are being stored
separately here as they may be required to be "translated" prior to use in formal pages and it save on effort if
they need to be recreated or edited.


W\left ( b_k, p_x \right )=\frac{1}{b_k} \sum_{i=1}^{n_x} d\left ( p_i \right )g \left[
\frac{f \left ( p_x, p_i \right )}{b_k} \right]



V\left ( b_k \right )=\frac{1}{n_x} \sum_{i=1}^{n_x} W^2 \left ( b_k, p_i \right )


P\left ( p_i \right )=\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} W^2 \left ( b_k, p_i \right )
